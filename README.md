# OffTheRecord
Contributions for my planned Podcast Off The Record. A conversational style podcast looking at people in the development and technical space. Exploring the stories of said people...

I Would like to focus on people in New Zealand, but there's no hard and fast rules here.

1. Why did they get in the game?
2. What they hope to achieve
3. Where they came from
4. Influences
5. Family life or life outside of the game
6. Achievements
7. ???

I've been influenced by the style of [http://thisdeveloperslife.com](This Developers Life podcast), but here we will focus on poeple's stories rather than themes.

My inspiration for creating this podcast "Off the record", came from the great inteview show on Radio Sport by Graeme Hill. Off The Record had such a great feel and Graeme did a great job uncovering some of the great and unique moments of sports legends, in a relaxed conversational style.

If you have someone you would like on the show, then just create a pull request.
